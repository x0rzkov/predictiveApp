# predictiveApp
This is the code for the web app which in real time recommends products (using an item-based recommender system) and synchronously segments customers (using k-means clustering). 
It's developed in HTML, JavaScript and Python (for the Machine learning models).
If you'd like to read a summary on how the models are developed or would like to test the predictive app, click on this <a href="http://doubleee.pythonanywhere.com/predictiveApp" target="_blank">link</a>.<br>
